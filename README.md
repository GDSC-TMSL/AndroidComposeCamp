- `Less code` - Do more with less code and avoid entire classes of bugs. Code is simpler and easier to maintain.

- `Intuitive` - Just describe your UI, and Compose takes care of the rest. As app state changes, your UI automatically updates.

- `Accelerates Development` - Compatible with all your existing code so you can adopt when and where you want. Iterate fast with live previews and full Android Studio support.

- `Powerful` - Create beautiful apps with direct access to the Android platform APIs and built-in support for Material Design, Dark theme, animations, and more.

### Compose apps are written in the [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) programming language
